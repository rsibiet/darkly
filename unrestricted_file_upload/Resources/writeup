********** Unrestricted File Upload **********

URL :
- http://192.168.145.128/?page=upload

Preview :
Using a tampering tool (Burp) to intercept the request and modify the http-header before it reached the server.
We will test if the files uploaded are correctly check.

Steps :
- Launch and set Burp Suite.
- Set Firefox settings with Proxy and Burp Certificat.
- In Burp, go to Proxy/intercept and set Intercept Off to On.
- Now upload an unvalid file using the form and submit it.
- Going back to Burp we can see the first request made.
- In the Raw window:
	-> change the Content-Type `text/html` by `image/jpeg`
- Forward the request

Fix :
- Make sure to check the image signature using functions like `exif_imagetype` in Php.
- Never only rely on MIME cache because as we just saw it can be corrupted.
