********** Path_traversal **********

URL :
- http://192.168.145.128/index.php?page=../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd

Preview :
A path traversal attack allow to access to the files that are stored outside the web root folder.

Steps :
If we add '../' after the page key to get the current directory content, a popup appear.
This indicat us there is a potential security fault by running a traversal attack.
On Linux systems, users informations are stored in /etc/passwd. So we tried to go back directories one by one until we found the folder.

Fix :
- Never store sensitive configuration files at the web root.
- Ensure the user cannot supply all parts of the path. For instance using php basename() and realpath() functions.
- Use file access permission and code to restrict access to sensitive files.
