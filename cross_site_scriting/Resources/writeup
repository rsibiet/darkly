********** Cross site scripting (XSS) **********

URL :
- http://192.168.145.128/?page=media&src=nsa

Preview :
XSS attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into the web sites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. The data is included in dynamic content that is sent to a web user without being validated for malicious content.

Steps :
- Click on the NSA logo, which redirects us to a new page.

The objectif is to inject the script `<script>alert('hello')</script>` after the src key.
- Convert the script in base 64 with https://www.base64decode.org/
Result: PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnaGVsbG8nKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg==

- Now replace nsa by : 'data:text/html;base64,PHNjcmlwdD5hbGVydCgnaGVsbG8nKTwvc2NyaXB0Pg=='

Fix :
- Check and validate all dynamic data for malicious content ('htmlspecialchars' for instance).
