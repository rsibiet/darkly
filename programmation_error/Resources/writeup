Bad coding from programmer, errors appearing in navigator logs.

?page=feedback:83 Uncaught ReferenceError: checkForm is not defined
    at HTMLInputElement.onclick (?page=feedback:83)
onclick @ ?page=feedback:83
?page=feedback:57 Uncaught ReferenceError: mtxMessage is not defined
    at validate_form (?page=feedback:57)
    at HTMLFormElement.onsubmit (?page=feedback:68)

Steps :
- First we tried to create some XSS attacks
- The form seems to be handling XSS because we can see it removes the script tags passed to it
- After trying different solutions a flag appeared when we randomly entered a unique character ('a', 'c', 'p', ...)
- After looking at the page code using the navigator console we can see that the function call to handle the sign form doesn't exist
- There is also a typing error which causes the `validate_required()` function to not work properly. `mtxtMessage` is expected as a field value but `mtxMessage` is given instead.

Fix :
- Learn how to code properly
- Test your code
